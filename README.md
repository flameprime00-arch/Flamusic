# Flamusic
bored of subscription on Spotify or Soundcloud ? Flamusic, a freeware music  without ADS and Wi-Fi (.wav, .mp3 (working only on standart .mp3 bc of encoding issues)).

Since Flamusic is not digitally signed, Windows cannot verify a signature and will flag it as a potential threat, because Windows automatically treats unsigned software as potentially risky.
If it happens, you can ignore it.
